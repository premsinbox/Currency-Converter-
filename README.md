The provided code template is a starting point for building a basic Currency Converter web application. It consists of an HTML structure, CSS styles, and a JavaScript function.

HTML: The HTML structure defines the layout and elements of the Currency Converter web page. You need to add the necessary HTML content to create the user interface for the converter. This includes input fields for selecting the currencies, an input field for entering the amount, a display field to show the converted result, and a button to trigger the conversion.

CSS (styles.css): The CSS file is meant to be linked to the HTML file to apply visual styles to the Currency Converter page. You can add custom styles to make the application visually appealing and user-friendly.

JavaScript (script.js): The JavaScript code contains a function named convertCurrency(). This function is responsible for handling the currency conversion logic. Inside the function, you need to implement the actual conversion process based on the exchange rates or API calls, depending on how you plan to get the conversion rates.

Note: The provided JavaScript function is just a placeholder and doesn't contain the actual conversion logic. You need to add the relevant code inside the convertCurrency() function to perform the conversion and update the result field accordingly.

For a fully functional Currency Converter, you will likely need to:

Use real exchange rates obtained from an API or external data source.
Implement event listeners to handle user interactions, such as clicking the conversion button or changing the currency selections.
Perform the currency conversion calculations using the entered amount and exchange rates.
Update the result field to display the converted amount.
To achieve this, you can use JavaScript libraries for making API requests, or fetch the data using built-in fetch API, or set up a backend server to provide the exchange rate data. You can also consider using third-party currency conversion APIs to get the real-time rates.

Keep in mind that currency conversion can involve floating-point calculations, so it's important to handle rounding and precision carefully to avoid potential issues with decimal values.
